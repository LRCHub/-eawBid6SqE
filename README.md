[00:12.03] 15 years from now, I know it feels remote
[00:19.25] But picture it somehow in your head
[00:27.07] It's 1984
[00:30.92] And knocking on your door is the Brownshirt Stasi guard
[00:37.95] Boom, you're gone
[00:46.45] 
[00:41.35] And in the blood of the Kennedys
[00:46.43] The good ones get shot
[00:49.09] And in the absence of sympathies
[00:53.24] Won't you hear me out?
[01:04.24] 
[00:57.70] When it all burns down
[01:01.23] When it all burns down
[01:05.45] I will hold you close for the minute
[01:11.29] Yeah, I'll hold you for the minute it takes
[01:32.79] 
[01:21.75] 55 years from now, I know it sounds insane
[01:29.23] The dark fascist regime might be gone (might be gone)
[01:35.13] Oh, if you by then have forgiven me
[01:40.38] When push comes to shove
[01:43.15] We don't have to be enemies
[01:47.65] Won't you hear me out?
[01:58.65] 
[01:51.87] When it all burns down
[01:55.53] When it all burns down
[01:59.32] I will hold you close for the minute
[02:04.51] For the minute
[02:07.15] When it all burns down
[02:11.17] And the flames devour everything that we are
[02:17.02] I will hold you for the minute
[02:20.52] I will hold you for the minute it takes
[02:40.02] 
[02:27.53] With these words at hand
[02:30.91] The future is a foreign land
[02:34.97] So let us pray for more in 2024
[02:42.82] (2024) we could grow old together
[02:46.74] (2024) we could love one another
[02:50.63] (2024) and there will from then be peace forevermore (forever)
[02:58.29] Peace forevermore (and forever)
[03:13.79] 
[03:03.25] But if it all burns down
[03:07.19] If it all burns down
[03:11.15] I will hold you close for the minute
[03:16.20] For the minute
[03:18.77] If it all burns down
[03:22.68] And the flames devour everything that we are
[03:28.49] I will hold you for the minute
[03:32.11] I will hold you for the minute it takes
